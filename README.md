# CSharp-Threading

This was a project that was done to demonstrate threads in C#, we ask the user for their filename, the size of the file and how many threads we want to allocate to the process of this job. 
It will then use the built in string builder which will generate random lines of text based on the size the user entered and once the file is done being built will end each thread on a timely manner.
